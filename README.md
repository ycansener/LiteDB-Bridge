# LiteDB-Bridge

It's a model and a provider class that allow you to create object related data providers without any custom coding for LiteDB databases.

1- Extend AbstractEntityModel class to create your own model classes.
2- Create your provider class by extending it from AbstractEntityProvider class. Set type parameter as your model class. And generate missing functions.
3- If you would like to customize any function, just override them in your custom provider class.


IMPORTANT: Please do not hesitate to contribute to the code. All contributions would be greatly appreciated.
